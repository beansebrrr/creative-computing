Exercise 2: Simple Sums

This exercise takes the numbers '8' and '10', and adds them together
"""

# We have to declare two variables with the values 8 and 10 respectively.
# For this exercise, I will label them as 'num1' and 'num2'
num1 = 8
num2 = 10

# 'sum' is a new variable which will equate to the sum of 'num1' and 'num2'
sum = num1 + num2

# This will print the value of 'sum' to the terminal.
print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {sum}")
