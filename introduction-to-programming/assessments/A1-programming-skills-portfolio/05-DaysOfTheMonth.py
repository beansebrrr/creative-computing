Exercise 5: Days of the Month

Asks for a number representing a month, then tells how many days there are in said month.
I'm going to overcomplicate the leap-year requirement. Instead of asking whether or not it's
a leap year, I'll let the user input the year, and the program will determine if it's a leap
year or not.

"""
Comments:

Oh boy, I have a lot of explaining to do.

1.  I wanted to emulate a 'do-while' loop which I used when coding in C.
    It looked like the closest I could get was using 'while True', and use
    'break' once the condition has been met. In this case, I made the
    program repeatedly ask for an input as long as the input isn't valid.
    I eventually used this knowledge to improve my code in Exercise 3:
    Biography.

2.  After reading about it some more, I found some ways to combat the
    'input()' function's nature of always returning a string. I learned
    how to use the 'try-except' blocks. See line 39 and line 57. The
    program will first attempt to turn the user's input into an int,
    but if it returns an error, it skips that and runs the code under
    the 'except' block.

3.  As for the advanced requirements, which take leap years into account.
    I made an extra-complicated system. You can input Y or N for whether
    or not it's a leap year, but I also added another functionality. If
    you input a number, the program will treat that as a year, and will
    calculate if it's a leap year or not! This was so fun (and painful) to
    implement, but I think it was absolutely worth it.
