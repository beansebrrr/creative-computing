Exercise 1: Coding is Cool

This one's quite simple. We just have to print "Coding is Cool" using 3 variables.
"""

# Assign the words "Coding", "is", and "Cool" to each variable respectively.
word1 = "Coding"
word2 = "is"
word3 = "Cool"

# Use string concatenation to combine the variables and print the phrase.
print(word1+ word2+ word3)

# I could also make use of f-strings like so.
print(f"{word1} {word2} {word3}")

# This is especially useful for when I need to integrate variables
# into my print statements. I will make good use of this in later
# Exercises.
