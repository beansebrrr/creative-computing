# ✨ Creative Computing ✨
This repository serves as a collective collection of everything I have worked on while studying **Creative Computing** in **Metaverse Age Training Institute**.

## A Little Tour:
Because of its nature, most of the files stored here are from *Introduction to Programming*. Hey, I don't make the rules out here. But I will be cross-referencing my projects from here and there, just so that everything can be found easily.
