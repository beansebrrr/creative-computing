          <h2>Frieren</h2>
          <p>
            An elven mage who has lived for over a thousand
            years. She was the last apprentice of The Great
            Mage Flamme. After the death of Himmel the Hero,
            she set out on a journey with Fern and Stark to
            Aureole.

          <h2>Himmel</h2>
          <p>
            The human hero of the Hero's party. Himmel is a
            skilled swordsman who led the group in their 10
            year journey to the Demon King's castle. He died
            of old age under the star-lit skies.

          <h2>Heiter</h2>
          <p>
            The human (alcoholic) priest of the party. After
            the defeat of the Demon King, he continued to
            serve the church and became a bishop. He adopted
            and raised a young Fern until she became strong
            enough to be a mage. Heiter died of a very old age.

          <h2>Eisen</h2>
          <p>
            A dwarven warrior who fought alongside the Hero
            Party. A dwarf's lifespan is longer than of a
            human's, but shorter than of an elf. He's a
            headstrong man who embraces his fear. He raised
            and trained Stark until the kid ran off after
            an argument.
