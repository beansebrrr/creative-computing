      <h1>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          The demon king had been defeated by the
          legendary party of heroes—Frieren the elven
          mage, Eisen the dwarven warrior, Heiter the
          priest, and Himmel the hero. The era of peace
          has begun, and it's time for the party to bid
          their farewells. But time flows differently for
          elves, and Frieren realizes as she sees her
          comrades age and pass.
        </p>
        <p>
          This story follows the journey of Frieren in
          the new era, learning to live alongside humans
          and appreciating their short lives all the more.

          <h2>Frieren</h2>
          <p>
            An elven mage who has lived for over a thousand
            years. She was the last apprentice of The Great
            Mage Flamme. After the death of Himmel the Hero,
            she set out on a journey with Fern and Stark to
            Aureole.

          <h2>Himmel</h2>
          <p>
            The human hero of the Hero's party. Himmel is a
            skilled swordsman who led the group in their 10
            year journey to the Demon King's castle. He died
            of old age under the star-lit skies.

          <h2>Heiter</h2>
          <p>
            The human (alcoholic) priest of the party. After
            the defeat of the Demon King, he continued to
            serve the church and became a bishop. He adopted
            and raised a young Fern until she became strong
            enough to be a mage. Heiter died of a very old age.

          <h2>Eisen</h2>
          <p>
            A dwarven warrior who fought alongside the Hero
            Party. A dwarf's lifespan is longer than of a
            human's, but shorter than of an elf. He's a
            headstrong man who embraces his fear. He raised
            and trained Stark until the kid ran off after
            an argument.
